Hey there! I'm Tamjeed.

This is a blog that I started in the winter of my sophomore year of college at Columbia University, whose main campus is in Manhattan's Morningside Heights neighborhood. The blogsite was created using Ruby & Jekyll, and it uses a personally modified version of Jekyll's minima theme. 

If interested, here's my [personal webpage](https://tamjazad.github.io).
