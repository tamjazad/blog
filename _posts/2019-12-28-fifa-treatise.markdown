This post is (semi)satirical-ish, maybe.

A while ago, I read an [article][article-link] in Columbia's satirical Federalist student newspaper that I found to be a real knee-slapper<sup>TM</sup>. Additionally, it helped confirm what I already had surmised: the EA Sports game commonly known as `FIFA` has some popularity amongst the college male youth.

But this wasn't all. I felt emotionally validated after I read this article, because I played `FIFA` in the past. A lot. And I still play a lot. And this moves me to reflect upon what I hope is not the opinion of just myself, but of millions of other people.

I say that to the blessed and enlightened amongst us, this game called `FIFA` is not merely a game whose sweet enjoyments can be reached by some half-assed, timid "let me have a try once you guys are done playing, it looks kinda fun." 

No, it is rather both a physical manifestation and a cornerstone of a way of life, one that necessarily entails hardship to reach higher blessings and honors, carves out dedicated social communities and spaces, and binds people together in bonds of rivalrous, tear-jerking brotherhood, forged by hours, weeks, and years of blood, sweat, and swearing. 

Such things require commitment, goal-setting, and sacrifice. When the match is on and the boys are focused, bae can wait, assignment due tonight can wait, phone call home can wait, the people trying to study in the lounge while we're playing can suck it up and wait.

Until you find yourself skipping meals, neglecting your s/o, intentionally turning in assignments minutes before they're due, and opting out of Manhattan cuisine and nightlife on the weekends, solely because you can't control the urge of hearing the sweet sound of the Playstation turning on while leaning back on the couches with the boys, controllers in hands and confident smiles on faces, I can assure you that you do not know a most beautiful manifestation of happiness and you most definitely do not know a most tragic manifestation of pain.
