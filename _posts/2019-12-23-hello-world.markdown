I guess this is the beginning, and instead of a cheesy `hello world`, I'm gonna start with a `hello new york!`

This blog was made with `ruby`, `jekyll`, and `github pages.` I guess this was the first real time that I worked with either of the first two, and it was a real pain to set up, with all the debugging and hosting problems that I ran into.

A friend was making his personal page with a static website generator, and was describing the annoying probs he was running into; I guess you could say that after this, I understand his pain:)

Anyways, that's all for this time!
