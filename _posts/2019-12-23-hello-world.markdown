I guess this is the beginning, and instead of a cheesy `hello world`, I'm gonna start with a `hello nyc!`

This blog was made with `ruby`, `jekyll`, and `github pages.` I guess this was the first real time that I worked with either of the first two...and it was a real pain setting this up with all the debugging and hosting problems that I ran into during this process, but that only made me happier when it finally worked:)

A good friend of mine was making his personal page with a static website generator not too long ago, and was describing to me the annoying probs he was running into at that time; I guess you could say that after this, I finally understand his pain lol.

Anyways, that's all for this time,
